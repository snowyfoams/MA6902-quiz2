# MA6902 Lecture 09 - MRO Review Notes

## 1. MRO Organization Structure

### Three Maintenance Types
- **Line Maintenance**: Airport apron, quick turnaround, daily checks
- **Base Maintenance**: Hangar, heavy scheduled checks (A, C, D checks)
- **Component Workshops**: Repair & overhaul (Engine, Avionics, Mechanical, Structure)

### Why This Structure?
- **Economic**: Different skills/facilities = efficiency
- **Regulatory**: Authorities require separation of responsibilities
- **Operational**: Aircraft keeps flying while maintenance continues

### Supporting Departments
- Technical Services (Engineering, Planning, Training)
- Materials (Purchasing, Inventory, Stores)
- Quality (QA, QC, Reliability, Safety)

---

## 2. Maintenance Philosophy ⭐

### A. Redundancy
- Multiple backup systems
- Enables fail-safe/fail-passive/fail-operational design
- Allows condition monitoring for non-critical components

### B. Preventive Maintenance System
**Three Categories:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Hard-life** | Remove before time limit | Safety-critical with age degradation |
| **On-condition** | Periodic inspect & test | Tire treads, oil analysis |
| **Condition Monitoring** | Operate until fail | Redundant systems, avionics |

### C. Line Replaceable Unit (LRU)
- Quick component swap without troubleshooting
- Faulty unit → workshop repair
- Minimizes aircraft downtime

---

## 3. Main Drivers ⭐

### Two Primary Drivers:

**Economic Requirements:**
- Utilization (max flying hours)
- Cost minimization
- Operational readiness

**Regulatory Requirements:**
- Safety/Airworthiness
- Environmental compliance
- Passenger protection

---

## 4. Maintenance Strategy ⭐⭐⭐

### Ultimate Objective (THREE GOALS):
1. **Keep aircraft flying as much as possible**
2. **At lowest cost of maintenance**
3. **Ensuring safety**

---

## 5. Maintenance Program Objectives

### Five Key Objectives:
1. Realize **inherent safety and reliability** levels
2. **Restore** reliability when deterioration occurs
3. Obtain info for **program optimization**
4. Obtain info for **design improvement**
5. Achieve at **minimum total cost** (maintenance + residual failures)

---

## 6. Airworthiness Management

### Three Components:
1. **Design Airworthiness**: Meets certification standards
2. **Production**: Manufacturing meets standards
3. **Continuing Airworthiness**: Maintains certified condition throughout life

### Key Principle:
Aircraft is airworthy when:
- Conforms to Type Design
- In condition for safe operation
- Has valid Certificate of Airworthiness

---

## 7. FAA vs EASA Philosophy

### FAA: "Approve and Monitor"
- Performance-based, flexible
- Operator develops programs
- Trust with accountability

### EASA: "Certify and Verify"
- Prescriptive, standardized
- Detailed requirements
- Formal certification processes

---

## 8. Maintenance Checks

### Classification:
- **Hard-life**: Remove before interval (safety-critical)
- **On-Condition**: Periodic inspection (detectable degradation)
- **Condition Monitoring**: Operate-to-failure (redundant systems)

### Typical Intervals:
- **Transit Check**: After each flight
- **A-Check**: ~1,000 hrs
- **C-Check**: ~3,000 hrs
- **D-Check**: ~25,000 hrs (heavy maintenance)

---

## 9. MSG-3 Approach

### Task-Oriented (Top-Down):
- Analyzes consequences of failure at **system level**
- Three categories: Airframe Systems, Structural Items, Zonal

### Failure Categories:
1. **Evident to crew?** → Yes/No
2. **Affects safety?** → Safety/Operational/Economic
3. **Hidden failure + related failure = safety impact?**

### Tasks:
- Lubrication, Servicing, Inspection
- Functional Check, Operational Check
- Restoration, Discard

---

## 10. Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Redundancy** | Multiple backup systems |
| **LRU** | Line Replaceable Unit - quick swap |
| **Inherent Reliability** | Design-built reliability level |
| **Airworthiness** | Fitness for safe flight |
| **Hard-life** | Mandatory removal before limit |
| **On-condition** | Inspect periodically, release if OK |
| **Condition Monitoring** | Operate until failure |

---

## EXAM FOCUS ⚠️

### Will Be Asked:
- Why separate Base/Line/Workshop? → Economic + Regulatory
- What does redundancy do? → Enables fail-safe, condition monitoring
- Three ultimate objectives? → Fly more / Low cost / Safety
- LRU concept importance? → Quick turnaround
- Main drivers? → Economic + Regulatory requirements

### Will NOT Be Asked:
- MSG-2/MSG-3 detailed calculations
- Quality assurance procedures details
- Reliability calculation methods
- Maintenance records specifics

**Remember:** Questions are CONCEPTUAL about WHY and IMPACT, not HOW to operate!
