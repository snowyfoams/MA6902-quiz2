## üìç Topic 3: Fail-Operational vs. Fail-Passive ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Source:** Lecture 7, pp.13-14  
**Exam Focus:** Meaning, differences, IMPACT on operations  
**Priority:** HIGHEST - marked ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

---

### Context: Autoland System

**Autoland System:**
- Autopilot controls aircraft during final approach and landing
- Used in low visibility conditions
- Part of ILS (Instrument Landing System) operations

**Components:**
- Autopilot + Autothrust
- Radio altimeter
- Nose wheel steering
- Often used with autobrake

---

### ILS Autoland Categories (L7, p.12)

**Quick Reference:**

| Category | Decision Height | RVR Min | Visibility |
|----------|----------------|---------|------------|
| Cat 1 | 200 ft | 550m | Standard |
| Cat 2 | 100 ft | 300m | Low |
| Cat 3A | <100 ft | 200m | Very low |
| **Cat 3B** | **<50 ft** | **75m** | **Near-zero** |
| Cat 3C | None | <75m | Zero |

**Requirements for Cat 2 and Cat 3:**
- Airport must be certified
- Aircraft must be certified
- Pilots must be certified
- **Three autopilot channels** must be engaged (for Cat 3)

---

### Fail-Operational System (L7, p.14) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Definition:**
> A fail-operational system can **complete the landing after one system failure**

**Requirements:**
- **At least 2 autopilots engaged** for the approach
- **Three systems must be serviceable** so that failure of one still allows autoland
- This configuration allows **"no decision height"** approach

**How It Works:**
```
Normal Operation:
Autopilot 1 ‚îÄ‚îê
Autopilot 2 ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚Üí All three working, two actively controlling
Autopilot 3 ‚îÄ‚îò

After One Failure:
Autopilot 1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ FAILED ‚úó
Autopilot 2 ‚îÄ‚îê
Autopilot 3 ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚Üí Two remaining continue the landing
                 Landing proceeds normally
```

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Redundancy enables continued operation**
- System can tolerate a failure without pilot takeover
- Safety through multiple independent systems
- Task completion prioritized

---

### Impact of Fail-Operational Design

**Operational Capability:**
- ‚úÖ Allows **Cat 3B and Cat 3C operations** (near-zero/zero visibility)
- ‚úÖ **No decision height required** - can land in any visibility
- ‚úÖ Higher dispatch reliability in bad weather
- ‚úÖ Fewer diversions and delays

**Safety:**
- ‚úÖ Continued safe operation after failure
- ‚úÖ No sudden transition to manual control
- ‚úÖ System handles failure automatically
- ‚úÖ Reduced pilot workload during critical phase

**Economic:**
- ‚úÖ More flights completed in low visibility
- ‚úÖ Fewer diversions = lower costs
- ‚úÖ Better schedule reliability
- ‚úÖ Competitive advantage for airlines

**Complexity Trade-off:**
- Requires three independent autopilot systems
- Higher initial cost and complexity
- More sophisticated failure detection
- Worth it for operational capability gained

---

### Fail-Passive System (L7, p.14) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Definition:**
> A fail-passive system is normally a **single autopilot approach**. Failure **does not cause immediate deviation** from flight path, but pilot must **immediately assume control**.

**Requirements:**
- Typically one autopilot system
- Must have **sufficient visual reference** to land after failure
- Lowest allowable decision height: **50 feet**

**How It Works:**
```
Normal Operation:
Autopilot 1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Single system controlling approach

After Failure:
Autopilot 1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ FAILED ‚úó
                ‚Üì
            No immediate dangerous deviation
            Aircraft continues briefly on last trajectory
                ‚Üì
            Pilot takes over manual control
                ‚Üì
            Must have visual reference to land
            OR execute missed approach
```

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Safe handoff to pilot upon failure**
- Failure does not create immediate danger
- No sudden pitch/roll/yaw deviation
- Pilot has time to assess and take over
- Simpler system, lower cost

---

### Impact of Fail-Passive Design

**Operational Capability:**
- ‚úÖ Minimum decision height: **50 feet**
- Limited to **Cat 1 and Cat 2** operations (not Cat 3B/3C)
- Requires pilot readiness to take over
- Cannot operate in near-zero visibility

**Safety:**
- ‚úÖ Safe transition to manual control
- ‚úÖ No dangerous deviation on failure
- ‚úÖ Pilot remains in the loop
- ‚úÖ Simpler system = fewer potential failures

**Economic:**
- ‚úÖ Lower system cost (one autopilot vs. three)
- ‚úÖ Simpler maintenance
- ‚úÖ Adequate for most operations
- ‚ùå More diversions in very low visibility

**Design Trade-off:**
- Lower capability in exchange for simplicity
- Appropriate for aircraft/routes with good weather
- Sufficient for majority of operations

---

### Key Differences - Comparison Table ‚≠ê

**MEMORIZE THIS TABLE**

| Aspect | Fail-Operational | Fail-Passive |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **After failure** | **Continues landing automatically** | **Pilot takes over manually** |
| **Systems required** | **3 total (2 engaged + 1 backup)** | **1 system** |
| **Minimum decision height** | **None (Cat 3C capable)** | **50 feet** |
| **Operational capability** | **Cat 3B/3C (near-zero visibility)** | **Cat 1/2 (requires visibility)** |
| **On failure** | **Two systems continue** | **No immediate deviation, but pilot controls** |
| **Design philosophy** | **Redundancy completes task** | **Safe handoff to pilot** |
| **Complexity** | **Higher (3 systems)** | **Lower (1 system)** |
| **Cost** | **Higher** | **Lower** |
| **Use case** | **Airports with frequent low visibility** | **Most general operations** |

---

### The "Fail-Operational" vs. "Fail-Passive" Names

**Fail-Operational:**
- "Operational" = continues operating, completes the operation
- System remains operational after failure
- Task continues without interruption

**Fail-Passive:**
- "Passive" = becomes passive, hands off control
- System becomes passive/inactive after failure
- Does not fight pilot control
- Safe state, but requires pilot action

**Focus on:** Evolutionary milestones (last part of chapter), which technology gives important change

#### **Impact on Fuselage (L7, pp.54-56)**

‚úÖ **Pressure difference makes fatigue strength very important** (Key Points Doc)

**Why Pressurization Critical:**
- Cruise altitude: 35,000-41,000 ft (ambient pressure: 3.5 psi)
- Cabin maintained at: 6,000-8,000 ft equivalent (11 psi)
- Pressure differential: 8-9 psi
- This creates stress on fuselage structure

**Evolutionary Milestones to Know (L7, pp.56-57, 60):**

1. **Lockheed XC-35 (1937)**: First pressurized aircraft
2. **Boeing 307 (1938)**: First pressurized airliner
3. **De Havilland Comet (1949)**: First jet with full pressurization
4. **Modern standard**: 6,000 ft cabin altitude (vs. 8,000 ft earlier)

**Impact on Design:**
- Fuselage becomes pressure vessel
- Fatigue-resistant materials required
- Window design critical (stress concentration)
- Door seals and pressure relief systems essential

**Likely Question:**
- "Why is cabin pressurization important for jet aircraft?"
- "What is the main structural impact of cabin pressurization?"
- "What cabin altitude standard is used in modern aircraft?"

---
### Exam Preparation - Autoland Systems

**Likely Question Formats:**

"What does 'fail-operational' mean in autoland system design?"
- Answer: System can complete landing after one system failure; requires 3 systems (2 engaged + 1 backup)

"What is the difference between fail-operational and fail-passive autoland systems?"
- Answer: Fail-operational continues landing after failure (3 systems), fail-passive requires pilot takeover (1 system, 50 ft minimum)

"What is the impact of fail-operational design?"
- Answer: Enables near-zero visibility operations (Cat 3B/3C), higher dispatch reliability, fewer diversions

"A fail-passive autoland system:"
- Correct answers: requires pilot takeover after failure, minimum 50 ft decision height, does not cause immediate deviation
- Wrong answer: continues landing automatically after failure (that's fail-operational)

**Key Phrases to Remember:**
- *"Fail-operational: can complete landing after failure"*
- *"Fail-operational requires 3 systems, 2 engaged"*
- *"Fail-operational enables no decision height"*
- *"Fail-passive: no immediate deviation, but pilot takes over"*
- *"Fail-passive: minimum 50 feet decision height"*
