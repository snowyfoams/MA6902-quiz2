# MA6902 LECTURE 10 - TARGETED EXAM REVIEW NOTES

## **MRO: Reliability, Quality Assurance, Production Planning & Control**

---

## **SECTION A: RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT** üéØüéØüéØ

### **1. Core Concept: Availability vs Reliability**

**KEY DISTINCTION:**
- When discussing **"reliability"** in aviation, we actually mean **"availability"**
- **Availability** = readiness of a system to perform when called upon
- **WHY IT MATTERS**: Availability is what makes money; no availability = no revenue

---

### **2. Three Types of Availability Formulas**

#### **Inherent Availability (Ai)** - PPT Page 3
```
Ai = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
```
- **MTBF** = Mean Time Between Failures
- **MTTR** = Mean Time To Repair
- **Characteristics**: Ideal state; only considers corrective maintenance
- **Depends on**: Basic reliability and maintainability (by design)

#### **Achieved Availability (Aa)** - PPT Page 4
```
Aa = MTBMA / (MTBMA + MMT)
```
- **MTBMA** = Mean Time Between Maintenance Actions
- **MMT** = Mean Maintenance Time
- **Includes**: Preventive + Corrective maintenance

#### **Operational Availability (Ao)** - PPT Page 4
```
Ao = MTBMA / (MTBMA + MDT)
```
- **MDT** = Mean Down Time
- **Includes**: All downtime (maintenance + delays before maintenance begins)
- **Most realistic** measure; always **much less** than Ai

---

### **3. WHY These Equations Are CRITICAL** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**EXAM FOCUS**: "Why is this equation so important?"

**ANSWER**: 
- Availability directly impacts **profitability**
- If aircraft not available ‚Üí not making money
- Airlines must balance maintenance needs vs revenue generation
- Operational Availability is the **true measure** of fleet performance

---

### **4. Aircraft Maintenance Philosophy** - PPT Page 6

**EXAM QUESTION**: "What is aircraft maintenance - science, art, or philosophy?"

**ANSWER**: **ALL THREE** (Lindley R. Higgins)

| Aspect | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **Science** | Execution relies on most/all sciences |
| **Art** | Identical problems receive varying approaches; some personnel show greater aptitude |
| **Philosophy** | Can be applied intensively, modestly, or not at all; depends on variables that transcend obvious solutions |

---

### **5. Types of Reliability** - PPT Page 18-19 üéØüéØüéØ

#### **A. Dispatch Reliability** ‚≠ê MOST IMPORTANT
- **Definition**: Overall airline reliability measurement
- **Standard**: 15-minute delay threshold
- **Example**: 96% target = max 4 delays >15 min per 100 departures
- **Significance**: Good overall long-term indicator of Maintenance Program effectiveness
- **Limitation**: Many systemic problems don't contribute directly to delays (hidden issues)

#### **B. Maintenance Reliability** ‚≠ê MOST IMPORTANT
- **Definition**: Internal maintenance reliability system
- **Purpose**: Must back up dispatch reliability
- **Focus**: Component-level and system-level performance
- **Data**: Published quarterly; first thing to check for problem components

#### **C. Statistical Reliability**
- **Measurement**: Failures or removals per 1,000 hours OR per 100 cycles
- **Used for**: Components
- **Challenge**: Subject to variations (seasonal use, phase of flight)
- **Alert Levels**: Set very low; requires careful understanding to avoid false alarms

#### **D. Historical Reliability**
- **Basis**: Historical data only
- **Alerts**: Based on significant deviations from previous years
- **Limitation**: No basis to determine if real problem exists ("watch what happens")
- **Evolution**: Transitions to Statistical Reliability when sufficient data collected

#### **E. Event-Oriented Reliability**
- **Focus**: One-time events with significant operational impact
- **Examples**: 
  - IFSD (In-Flight Shut Down)
  - Hard landings
  - Bird strikes
  - Lightning strikes
- **Significance**: Infrequent but high impact (e.g., affects EDTO/ETOPS)

---

### **6. Critical Reliability Metrics** - PPT Page 5 üéØüéØ

#### **TBR vs MTBUR Analysis**

**Two Key Figures:**

| Metric | Definition | Includes |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **TBR** | Time Between Removal | ALL removals (failed + non-failed) |
| **MTBUR** | Mean Time Between Unscheduled Removal | ONLY failed items |

**ANALYSIS:**
- **If TBR ‚âà MTBUR** ‚Üí ‚úÖ GOOD (most removals are failures)
- **If TBR << MTBUR** ‚Üí ‚ùå PROBLEM
  - Example: MTBUR = 20,000 hrs (good), TBR = 7,000 hrs (bad)
  - **Indicates**: High unnecessary removals OR poor troubleshooting

**EXAM RELEVANCE**: Differentiation question likely

---

### **7. Reliability Program Elements** - PPT Page 20

**Seven Basic Elements:**
1. Data Collection
2. Problem Detection and Alert
3. Data Display
4. Data Analysis
5. Corrective Actions
6. Follow-up Analysis

---

### **12. Material Planning** - PPT Page 28 üéØüéØüéØ

**EXAM CRITICAL**: Material Classification

| Category | Chinese | Definition | Example |
|----------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Rotable** | ÂèØ‰øÆ‰ª∂ | Serialized and repairable | Landing gear, APU |
| **Recoverable** | ÂèØÂõûÊî∂‰ª∂ | Units with no detailed parts breakdown | Some electronics |
| **Expendable** | Ê∂àËÄó‰ª∂ | Consumables | Filters, seals, oil |
| **Warranty** | ‰øù‰øÆ‰ª∂ | Under manufacturer warranty | New components |

**Provisioning Factors:**
- Fleet size and utilization
- Quantity per aircraft
- Component life
- MTBUR
- Downtime
- Station holding

**EXAM TIP**: Potential question on differentiating these four categories

---

### **13. Green Time Concept** üéØ

**Definition**: Unused approved flying hours on a component before mandatory removal

**Scenario Example:**
- Component limit: 10,000 hours
- Current: 9,950 hours
- Remaining: 50 hours (Green Time)
- Aircraft flying to London (8-hour flight)

**Dilemma:**

| Option | Action | Consequence |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **A** | Remove now | **Lose green time** (50 hrs unused capacity) |
| **B** | Let it fly | **Risk grounding** in London if exceeds limit |

**Philosophy**: Risk management
- **Too much buffer** ‚Üí Costs money (wasted green time)
- **Not enough buffer** ‚Üí Delays and groundings
- Must balance operational needs vs maintenance efficiency

---

### **14. Aircraft Utilization** - PPT Page 35 üéØüéØ

**EXAM CONCEPT**: "What is utilization?"

**ANSWER**: For every 24 hours, how many hours on average can the aircraft fly

**Examples:**

| Annual Flight Hours | Daily Utilization |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| 3,000 hrs/year | 8.22 hrs/day |
| 4,000 hrs/year | 10.96 hrs/day |
| 5,000 hrs/year | 13.70 hrs/day |
| 6,000 hrs/year | 16.44 hrs/day |

**WHY IT MATTERS:**
- **High utilization** = More revenue generation
- **Key driver** of total cost of ownership
- Airlines constantly work to maximize utilization while ensuring maintenance

**EXAM TIP**: Understand concept, not exact calculations

---

### **15. Aircraft Assignment Considerations** - PPT Page 31-32

**Objective**: Improve utilization while ensuring adequate maintenance downtime

**Seven Considerations:**
1. Aircraft type and configuration
2. Route pattern, time-tables, frequencies
3. Flying hours - time remaining to checks (**Green Time**)
4. Availability of standby aircraft
5. Home base and station capabilities (spares support)
6. Contractual arrangements (code sharing)
7. Special flights (training, ferry, charter)

---

## **SECTION D: MAINTENANCE COST STRUCTURE** üéØüéØ

### **16. Maintenance Cost Percentage** - PPT Page 37-38

**EXAM QUESTION**: "What percentage of operating costs is maintenance?"

**ANSWER**: Approximately **5-6%** (very stable over years)

**Singapore Airlines Example (2014/15):**
- Total Operating Cost: S$12,078.2M
- AMO Costs: S$655.7M
- **Percentage: 5.4%**

**Historical Trend (SIA):**
- 2013/14: 5.5%
- 2014/15: 5.4%
- 2015/16: 6.7%
- 2016/17: 7.3%
- 2017/18: 6.7%

**NOTE**: New aircraft typically have lower maintenance costs

---

### **17. Industry Cost Benchmarks**

**Direct Maintenance Cost per Flight Hour:**
- **Single-aisle**: US$650
- **Wide-body**: US$1,600

**Cost Breakdown:**
- **Engine maintenance**: ~40% of total maintenance cost
- **Labor**: ~70% of total maintenance cost

---

### **18. Typical Check Man-Hours** - PPT Page 35, 39

**Single Aisle (3,000 FH/year):**

| Check | Interval | Man-Hours | Annual M-H |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
