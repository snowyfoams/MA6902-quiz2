# LECTURE 12 QUIZ PREPARATION GUIDE
## Buying an Aircraft - Key Examination Points

Based on the quiz key points document and PPT content, here are the critical areas mapped to specific slides:

---

## **1. ESSENTIAL DESIGN FACTORS** (Slide 3)
**Potential Question Type**: Multi-choice selecting correct factors from mixed options

**Key Factors to Remember**:
- Market size
- Range & Size
- Cost & Finance
- Operational Cost (Fuel & Maintenance)
- Passenger appeal (Speed & Comfort)
- Operational Convenience (Airport and workers' friendly)
- **Dependability & Maintainability** (Dispatch Reliability)
- Standardisation
- Environment Friendly (air and noise pollution)

**Exam Strategy**: Recognize which factors ARE part of design criteria vs. which are NOT

---

## **2. HOURLY PRODUCTIVITY** (Slide 5)
**Critical Concept**: Understanding productivity evolution and impact on airline operations

**Evolution Table to Know**:
| Period | Aircraft | Hourly Productivity (ton-km/h) | Annual Capacity (000 ton-km) |
|--------|----------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1930s-40s | DC-3 | 527 | 1,571 |
| 1960s | Boeing 747 | 31,935 | 95,805 |
| 1980s | B747-400 | 44,350 | 210,440 |
| 2000s | Airbus A380 | 52,500 | 249,112 |

**Key Understanding**: 
- Higher productivity = more revenue potential per hour
- But comes with higher acquisition and operating costs
- Impact on airline profitability

**Potential Question**: Which aircraft has higher productivity? What is the operational impact?

## **3. SFE vs BFE** (Slides 7-16)
**VERY IMPORTANT - High probability exam question**

### **Seller Furnished Equipment (SFE)**:
**Definition**: Equipment provided by manufacturer as part of base aircraft

**Key SFE Components**:
- **Airframe & Structure**: Fuselage, wings, tail
- **Landing gear** (OBVIOUS SFE - cannot buy aircraft without it)
- Doors and emergency exits
- Flight controls (hydraulics, fly-by-wire)
- Core avionics (FMS, navigation systems)
- Environmental systems (air conditioning, pressurization)
- Fuel system
- Basic interior shell
- Emergency equipment
- Fire detection & suppression

### **Buyer Furnished Equipment (BFE)**:
**Definition**: Equipment selected and purchased separately by airline

**CRITICAL BFE Items to Remember**:

1. **ENGINES** (20-30% of aircraft cost)
   - Most important BFE item
   - Purchased separately from engine manufacturer
   - Examples: CFM, Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney

2. **SEATS** (All passenger seating)
   - Aircraft delivered WITHOUT seats
   - Airline selects configuration and supplier
   - Cost range: $2,000-150,000+ per seat depending on class

3. **In-Flight Entertainment (IFE)**
   - Seat-back screens or wireless systems
   - Not required for aircraft operation
   - Airline's choice for passenger experience

4. **Additional BFE**:
   - WiFi connectivity systems
   - Premium galley equipment (beyond basic)
   - Premium lavatory fixtures (beyond basic)
   - Interior branding and aesthetics
   - LED mood lighting systems

**Exam Strategy**: 
- Landing gear = OBVIOUSLY SFE
- Engines, Seats, IFE = ALWAYS BFE
- Basic galleys/lavatories = SFE; Premium upgrades = BFE

---

## **4. PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES** (Slides 28, 33-36)
**Technical concepts that may be tested**

### **Key Reliability Metrics**:

**Dispatch Reliability (DR)**:
- Definition: % of flights departing within 15 minutes without technical issues
- Industry target: >99%
- Formula: (Scheduled departures - Technical delays) / Scheduled departures × 100

**Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**:
- Average operating hours between system failures
- Target: 10,000+ hours for critical systems
- Understand the concept, not calculations

**Understand Difference**:
- Dispatch Reliability vs. Maintenance Reliability
- Both important to airline operations

---

## **5. ETOPS/EDTO RATING** (Not in provided slides but in key points)
**VERY IMPORTANT - MAY ASK TECHNICAL QUESTION**

### **Evolution and Concept**:

**Original Problem**:
- Twin-engine aircraft = 50% power loss if one engine fails
- Safety concern: Must reach airport within limited time

**ETOPS Evolution**:
- **Original**: 30 minutes (Extended Twin-Engine Operations)
- **ETOPS 180**: 3 hours capability
- **ETOPS 330**: 5.5 hours capability
- **EDTO**: Extended Diversion Time Operation (renamed, applies to all aircraft)

**Requirements for Extended ETOPS**:
1. Engine reliability must be proven
2. Aircraft emergency systems must sustain extended operation

**Operational Impact**:
- **30-minute rule**: Aircraft must "hug the coast" - cannot fly over ocean
- **ETOPS 180/330**: Can fly direct transoceanic routes
- Critical for route planning and aircraft purchase decisions

**Why Important in Purchase**:
- ETOPS rating affects which routes aircraft can fly
- Rating can change if reliability issues occur
- Example: Rolls-Royce engines - in-flight shutdown reduces ETOPS rating

## **6. RANGE PERFORMANCE** (Slides 37-42)
**Understanding optimal range concept**

### **Key Range Definitions**:

**Maximum Range**:
- Distance with maximum fuel, typical payload
- Marketing figure, rarely achieved operationally

**Design Range**:
- Distance with full payload (all seats filled)
- More realistic operational measure

**Harmonic Range** (IMPORTANT):
- **Optimal distance for fuel efficiency**
- **Usually 70-80% of maximum range**
- Aircraft designed to optimize at this range

### **Range-Payload Trade-off**:
**Critical Concept**: Cannot always carry full fuel AND full payload

**Formula**: MTOW = OEW + Payload + Fuel

**Example A350-900**:
- Short routes (3,000nm): Can carry 61,000 kg payload (full capacity)
- Ultra-long routes (8,100nm): Only 35,000 kg payload (restricted)

**Why This Matters**:
- Affects revenue potential on different routes
- Must consider when selecting aircraft for specific missions

## **7. COST DRIVERS & TCO** (Slides 44-49, 61)
**Understanding what drives total ownership cost**

### **Key Cost Drivers**:

1. **High Utilization**
   - More hours flown per day = lower cost per hour
   - Fixed costs spread over more flights

2. **Fuel Efficiency**
   - Largest variable operating cost (25-35%)
   - New generation aircraft: 15-20% improvement

3. **Maintenance Costs**
   - 10-15% of operating costs
   - Varies significantly with aircraft age and type

4. **Aircraft Utilization** (Slide 51-52)
   - **LCC target**: 11-13 hours/day
   - **Network carrier**: 8-10 hours/day
   - Faster turnaround = more daily flights = better economics

### **CASK (Cost per Available Seat Kilometer)**:
**Important Metric for Comparison**

**Formula**: Total Annual Costs / (Seats × Annual Miles)

**Typical CASK Values**:
- A321neo: 4.5-5.5 cents (most efficient narrowbody)
- 737 MAX 8: 5.0-6.0 cents
- 787-9: 4.0-5.0 cents
- A350-900: 4.2-5.2 cents

**What Influences CASK**:
- Aircraft size (larger = lower unit cost)
- Utilization (higher = lower unit cost)
- Fuel efficiency
- Maintenance costs

---

## **8. MATERIAL PLANNING TERMS** (Not in slides but in key points)
**Potential question on inventory management terms**

**Four Critical Terms**:

1. **Rotable (可修件)**:
   - Components that can be repaired and reused
   - Examples: Landing gear, actuators, pumps

2. **Recoverable (可回收件)**:
   - Components with parts that can be salvaged
   - May not be fully repairable but have reusable elements

3. **Expendable (消耗件)**:
   - Consumable items used once or until worn
   - Examples: Filters, seals, lubricants

4. **Warranty (保修件)**:
   - Components covered under manufacturer warranty
   - Special handling for claims and tracking

**Why Important**: Critical for inventory cost management

   - Range-payload trade-off concept

6. **Cost drivers** (Slides 44-49)
   - Utilization, fuel efficiency, maintenance
   - CASK concept

### **Lower Probability (But Understand Concepts)**:
