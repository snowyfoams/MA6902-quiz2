1. HYDRAULIC SYSTEM ⭐⭐⭐ (HIGH PRIORITY)
1920s-1930s:  ~1,000 PSI (landing gear only)
1940s (WWII): 1,500-2,000 PSI (power-assisted controls)
1950s-1960s:  3,000 PSI (jet age)
1970s-Present: 5,000 PSI (commercial standard)
2000s+:        8,000+ PSI (military aircraft)
```

### **THE CRITICAL EXAM QUESTION: Why 5,000 PSI?**

**Answer Framework:**
```
Higher Pressure = Higher Danger... So WHY do it?

ANSWER: Weight Saving (Primary Driver)

Logic Chain:
- Higher pressure → Smaller diameter pipes
- Smaller pipes → Less hydraulic fluid needed
- Less fluid + smaller components → WEIGHT REDUCTION
- Weight is everything in aircraft design

Analogy: Like electrical systems
- Higher voltage = smaller wires needed
- Higher pressure = smaller pipes needed
```

### **The Trade-Off: Problems with 5,000 PSI**

| Problem | Solution Required |
|---------|------------------|
| Increased leakage risk | New sealing technologies |
| Aluminum inadequate | **Titanium pipes** (critical fact) |
| Dangerous to work with | Advanced safety procedures |
| Higher implementation cost | Why some stay at 3,000 PSI |

### **SWaP Principle** (Memorize This)
```
S = Size    (smaller components)
W = Weight  (lighter systems) ← MAIN GOAL
P = Power   (reduced requirements)

This principle drives modern aircraft system design
```

### **Exam Tips:**
- ✅ Know the philosophy: weight reduction drives high pressure
- ✅ Remember titanium materials requirement
- ✅ Understand the leakage consequence
- ❌ Don't memorize detailed hydraulic diagrams
- ❌ Don't worry about component specifications

## **2. FLIGHT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FMS)** ⭐⭐⭐ (HIGH PRIORITY)

### **The Big Picture: What FMS Replaced**
```
BEFORE FMS (5 people in cockpit):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Pilot                            │
│ 2. Co-Pilot                         │
│ 3. Flight Engineer    ← ELIMINATED  │
│ 4. Navigator          ← ELIMINATED  │
│ 5. Radio Operator     ← ELIMINATED  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

AFTER FMS (2 people):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Pilot                            │
│ 2. Co-Pilot                         │
│                                     │
│ FMS does everything else!           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Impact: Save manpower BUT increase complexity
```

### **4 Main Functions** (Remember the 4 A's + N + P)

1. **A**utomatic Flight Control
2. Performance Management
3. **N**avigation and Guidance
4. Status & Warning

*Memory aid: "A-P-N-S" or think "Automatic Performance Navigation Status"*

### **⭐ NAV DATABASE - 28 DAY RULE** (VERY LIKELY EXAM QUESTION)
```
CRITICAL FACTS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
NAV data is VOLATILE (changes constantly)
→ Radio stations worldwide don't stay same
→ Waypoints, airways, frequencies change

REQUIREMENT: Update every 28 DAYS
→ This is MANDATORY for all FMS
→ Regulatory requirement
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What's in NAV Database:
- Airports (locations, runways, procedures)
- Standard flight routes (airways)
- Navigation aids (VOR, DME frequencies)
```

### **3 Strategic Performance Modes** (Know the Differences)

| Mode | Purpose | When Used |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **ECON** | Minimum operating cost/mile | Normal operations |
| **MIN FUEL** | Minimum fuel consumption | Fuel conservation priority |
| **MIN TIME** | Fastest flight (max speeds) | Schedule recovery |

*Exam tip: Most common question - "What does MIN FUEL vs MIN TIME mean?"*

### **4 Flight Phases**
```
1. Take-off
2. Climb
3. Cruise
4. Descent and Approach
```

### **FMS Information Sources** (Know Categories)

**Inputs FROM:**
- Flight Control Computer
- Thrust Management Computer (TMC)
- Air Data Computer (ADC)
- EICAS/ECAM
- Navigation sensors (IRS, GPS, VOR, DME)

**Outputs TO:**
- Autopilot (roll/pitch channels)
- Autothrottle (thrust control)
- Flight displays (EFIS)
- Pilot interface (CDU - Control Display Unit)

### **Impact Questions (Likely Format)**

**Q: Did FMS save money?**
- ✅ Yes - eliminated 3 crew positions
- ❌ But - high implementation cost
- ❌ But - increased maintenance complexity

**Q: Is FMS easy to maintain?**
- ❌ No - very complex systems
- Requires specialized training
- Software updates needed

### **What WON'T Be Asked:**
- ❌ Detailed FMS operation procedures
- ❌ Waypoint calculations
- ❌ Top of descent computations
- ❌ Specific storage formats

## **3. AUTOPILOT** ⭐⭐ (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### **Key Concepts Only**

**Evolution Path:**
```
Early (1950s-60s):
→ Basic attitude hold (pitch, roll, yaw)
→ Heading and altitude hold
→ Required constant pilot monitoring

Modern (1990s+):
→ Full flight regime control
→ Takeoff to landing capability
→ FMS integration for complete automation
```

### **What Autopilot Controls**
```
Three Control Channels:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ROLL Channel   → Aileron Control   │
│ PITCH Channel  → Elevator Control  │
│ YAW Channel    → Rudder Control    │
└────────────────────────────────────┘

Plus integration with:
- Autothrottle (thrust control)
- FMS (flight plan following)
- EFIS (display integration)
```

### **Exam Focus:**
- ✅ Understand evolution concept
- ✅ Know integration with FMS
- ❌ Don't memorize technical operation details
- ❌ Don't worry about old computer systems

### **⭐ THE CRITICAL EXAM QUESTION: Future of IFE**

**Question Format:** "What is the future of in-flight entertainment?"

**Answer Framework:**
```
TREND: Diminishing Usefulness vs Progressive Usefulness?

CURRENT REALITY:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Passengers increasingly DON'T CARE about IFE

WHY?
→ Mobile phones have ALL entertainment they want
→ Personal devices = personalized content
→ Passengers bring their own entertainment
→ Netflix, Spotify, games on personal devices
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HISTORICAL BUSINESS STRATEGY:
- Airlines reduced food investment
- Gave entertainment instead of meals
- Logic: Watching movies = not eating
- SAVED money on food + SAVED weight
  (less food to carry)

FUTURE DIRECTION:
- Focus shifts to CONNECTIVITY not content
- High-speed internet is what matters
- Passengers stream their own content
- BYOD (personal device) becomes primary
- Airline IFE may become secondary
```

5,000 = modern standard
Titanium = required material
Weight = why we do it
```

### **FMS Impact**
```
"5 to 2, Thanks to FMS"
5 crew → 2 crew
28 days → NAV update
```

### **IFE Eras**
```
"Pneumatic → Electric → Video → Digital → Broadband → Personal"
P-E-V-D-B-P (6 stages)
```

### **Strategic Modes**
```
"Economy, Fuel, Time" = EMT
ECON = cheapest
MIN FUEL = least fuel
MIN TIME = fastest
