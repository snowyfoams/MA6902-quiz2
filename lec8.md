# LECTURE 8 KEY POINTS SUMMARY - AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS

Based on the quiz key points and PPT content, here are the critical examination topics:

---

## **1. HYDRAULIC SYSTEM**

### **Pressure Evolution Philosophy** (⭐⭐⭐)

**Historical Progression:**
- Early systems: 1,500-2,000 PSI
- Jet Age: 3,000 PSI  
- Modern standard: **5,000 PSI**
- Advanced military: 8,000+ PSI

**Why 5,000 PSI? (Philosophy Question)**

The fundamental answer relates to **SWaP Principle**:
- **S**ize - smaller components
- **W**eight - weight reduction (primary driver)
- **P**ower - reduced power requirements

**Key Reasoning:**
- Higher pressure = smaller pipes/components
- Less hydraulic fluid required
- Reduced system weight throughout aircraft
- Similar to electrical systems: higher voltage enables smaller wires

**Consequences of 5,000 PSI:**
- **Increased leakage risk** - pressure differential creates sealing challenges
- Requires advanced materials: **titanium pipes** (aluminum insufficient)
- New joining technologies and valve designs needed
- Higher implementation costs (why some aircraft remain at 3,000 PSI)

**Exam Focus:** Understand the philosophy and trade-offs, not operational details.

## **2. FLIGHT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FMS)**

### **Main Functions** (4 Core Areas)

1. **Automatic Flight Control** - integrates with autopilot and autothrottle
2. **Performance Management** - optimizes aircraft efficiency
3. **Navigation and Guidance** - manages flight path
4. **Status & Warning** - monitors aircraft systems

### **FMS Information Sources**

**Receives data from:**
- Flight Control Computer
- Thrust Management Computer (TMC)
- Air Data Computer (ADC)
- EICAS/ECAM systems
- IRU (Inertial Reference Unit)
- VOR, DME, ADF, ILS, Weather Radar
- Engine sensors

### **NAV Database** (⭐)

**Critical Fact:**
- NAV data is **volatile** (changes over time)
- **Must be updated every 28 days** (regulatory requirement)
- Contains: airports, standard routes, navigation aids
- Radio stations and waypoints change globally

**Why 28 Days?** Ensures currency of navigation information worldwide.

### **Strategic Performance Modes** (3 Choices)

1. **ECON (Economic)** - minimum operating cost per mile
2. **MIN FUEL** - speed/Mach for minimum fuel consumption
3. **MIN TIME** - maximum flight envelope speeds

### **Flight Phases** (4 Phases)
- Take-off
- Climb
- Cruise  
- Descent and Approach

### **Historical Impact** (Potential Exam Question)

**Cockpit Crew Reduction:**
- Historical: **5 people** (Pilot, Co-Pilot, Flight Engineer, Navigator, Radio Operator)
- Modern: **Only 2 people**
- FMS eliminated 3 positions: Flight Engineer, Navigator, Radio Operator

**Impact Questions:**
- Saved manpower but increased system complexity
- High implementation cost
- More complex maintenance requirements
- Significant operational efficiency gains

**Exam Note:** Won't ask detailed FMS operation (too complex), focus on impact and concepts.

## **3. AUTOPILOT**

### **Evolution Concept**

**Historical Development:**
- Early autopilots: basic attitude stabilization
- Modern systems: full flight regime control from takeoff to landing
- Integration with FMS for complete flight management

**Key Components:**
- Roll Channel → Aileron Control
- Pitch Channel → Elevator Control  
- Mode Target Requests → Thrust Lever Control (autothrottle)

**Exam Focus:** 
- Evolution of autopilot capabilities
- Integration with other aircraft systems
- Won't ask about old computer details or operational specifics

## **4. IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT (IFE)**

### **Evolution Stages** (Must Understand Progression⭐)

**1. Pneumatic Era (1960s-1970s)**
- Pneumatic tube audio distribution
- 2-4 channels maximum
- Poor quality, passengers paid rental fees

**2. Electromagnetic Era (1970s-1980s)**  
- Magnetic loop systems
- Up to 12 audio channels
- Stereo capability introduced

**3. Video Introduction (1980s-1990s)**
- Overhead CRT monitors (Northwest Orient pioneer, 1985)
- Shared screens, no individual control
- VHS tape content

**4. Digital Revolution (1990s-2000s)**
- Seat-back LCD screens (Virgin Atlantic pioneer)
- AVOD (Audio Video On Demand)
- Individual content selection
- Digital storage servers

**5. Modern Broadband Era (2000s-2010s)**
- HD displays (10-18 inch)
- Wi-Fi connectivity (Ku-band, Ka-band satellites)
- Touchscreen interfaces
- Massive content libraries (1,000+ hours)

**6. Contemporary Systems (2010s-Present)**
- 4K/OLED displays (up to 32-inch in premium)
- Android-based platforms
- LEO satellites (Starlink)
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) integration
- Free Wi-Fi increasingly standard

### **Future of IFE** (⭐⭐⭐)

**Key Question:** Is IFE experiencing **diminishing usefulness** or **progressive usefulness**?

**Current Reality:**
- Passengers increasingly rely on personal mobile devices
- Mobile phones provide personal entertainment preferences
- Reduced dependence on airline-provided systems

**Historical Business Strategy:**
- Airlines reduced food service investment
- Provided entertainment to distract from meals
- **Saved money on food and reduced food weight**

**Future Considerations:**
- Enhanced connectivity (5G, LEO satellites)
- VR/AR immersive experiences
- AI-driven personalization
- Sustainability focus (lightweight systems, energy efficiency)
- Greater integration with personal devices

**Exam Perspective:** Understand the trend toward passenger-controlled entertainment via personal devices potentially reducing IFE importance, though connectivity remains critical.
