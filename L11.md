# MA 6902 Lecture 11 Quiz Key Points Summary

## Core Economic Concepts

### 1. **Airline Profit Fundamentals** (PPT pg. 3)
- **Profit = Yield - Cost**
- **Yield**: Revenue from passengers
- **Cost**: All operational expenditures (maintenance, pilots, fuel, etc.)
- Both influenced by sector length, government policies, network structure

### 2. **Key Revenue Metrics** (PPT pg. 5)

**RPK (Revenue Passenger Kilometer)**
- Formula: `RPK = Number of paying passengers × Distance flown`
- Example: 100 passengers × 500 km = 50,000 passenger-km

**ASK (Available Seat Kilometer)**
- Formula: `ASK = Total seats × Distance flown`
- Represents airline capacity

**Load Factor**
- Formula: `Load Factor = (Seats filled / Total seats available) × 100`
- Critical profitability indicator

**Yield**
- Average fare per passenger-km
- Example: $0.15/passenger-km

**RASK (Revenue per Available Seat Kilometer)**
- Formula: `RASK = Total revenue / ASKs`

### 3. **Key Cost Metrics** (PPT pg. 8)

**CASK (Cost per Available Seat Kilometer)**
- Formula: `CASK = Total costs / ASKs`
- Unit economics fundamental

**CASK-ex**
- CASK excluding fuel costs
- Used for operational efficiency comparison

**Break-even Load Factor**
- Load factor needed to cover costs
- Industry typically requires 75-85% to break even

**Profitability Equation**
- If **RASK < CASK** → airline loses money
- **RASK - CASK spread** = key profitability indicator

### 4. **Direct vs Indirect Operating Costs** (PPT pg. 7, 9)

**Direct Operating Costs (DOC)**
- **Fuel costs** (20-35%): Most volatile
- **Landing fees**: Only paid when flying

**Indirect Operating Costs (IOC)**
- **Staff costs** (25-35%): Paid regardless of flight operations
- **Depreciation**: Paid whether flying or not

**Mixed Category**
- **Maintenance** (10-15%): 
  - Direct: Depends on flight hours
  - Indirect: Time-based checks even if not flying

## Airline Business Models (PPT pg. 10)

### **Full-Service Carriers (FSC)**
- Examples: Singapore Airlines, Emirates, United
- Multiple fare classes, included services
- Hub-and-spoke networks
- Premium cabins (First, Business)

### **Low-Cost Carriers (LCC)**
- Examples: Southwest, Ryanair, AirAsia
- Unbundled pricing, point-to-point
- High aircraft utilization
- Single class configuration

### **Ultra-Low-Cost Carriers (ULCC)**
- Examples: Spirit, Frontier, Wizz Air
- Extreme unbundling
- Charge for everything (carry-ons, water)

## Cabin Product Categories (PPT pg. 11, 13)

### **Class Structure**
- **First Class**: 10-20% revenue, <1% seats (80-87" pitch)
- **Business Class**: 40-50% revenue, 10-15% seats (60-78" pitch)
- **Premium Economy**: 10-15% revenue, 8-12% seats (38-42" pitch)
- **Economy**: 30-40% revenue, 70-80% seats (28-32" pitch)

### **Cabin Profitability**
- Premium cabins generate **60-80% of long-haul profit**
- Critical for network carrier economics

## Ancillary Revenue (PPT pg. 14)

### **Pre-flight**
- Seat selection ($10-200)
- Extra baggage ($30-100+)
- Lounge access ($25-75)
- Priority boarding

### **In-flight**
- Food & beverage ($5-30)
- WiFi ($8-30)
- Entertainment (rare now)

### **Ancillary Revenue Significance**
- **15-40% of total revenue for LCCs**
- Major revenue diversification strategy

## Historical Evolution (PPT pg. 15-20)

### **1950s-1960s: Golden Age**
- Single premium class for elite
- Spacious seating (38-40" pitch)
- Government-set fares

### **1970s: Deregulation**
- US Airline Deregulation Act (1978)
- Introduction of economy class
- Hub-and-spoke networks emerge
- Frequent flyer programs launched (1981)

### **2000s: Unbundling**
- Seat pitch shrinks (34" → 30-31")
- Checked bag fees introduced (2008 crisis)
- Lie-flat business class standard
- Ancillary revenue explosion

### **2020s: Post-Pandemic**
- Business travel permanently reduced (~20-30%)
- Premium leisure boom
- Sustainability becomes differentiator
- Hygiene as product feature

## Future Challenges & Opportunities (PPT pg. 21-27)

### **1. Sustainability Pressure**
- Net-zero by 2050 target
- SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) premium fares
- Carbon offset programs
- Premium cabins scrutinized (3-4× emissions per passenger)

### **2. Business Travel Decline**
- 20-30% permanent reduction estimated
- Zoom/Teams normalized
- Shift to premium leisure targeting
- "Bleisure" (business + leisure) products

### **3. Technology Disruption**
- AI-driven personalization
- Biometric boarding
- Blockchain for loyalty programs
- VR/AR entertainment

### **4. Future Aircraft Technologies**
- **Supersonic**: NYC-London in 3.5 hours (late 2020s-2030s)
- **Urban Air Mobility (UAM)**: Electric VTOL aircraft (2025-2030)
- **Hydrogen & Electric**: Short-haul electric by 2030s, hydrogen by 2035

### **5. Product Innovations**
- Personalized cabins
- Wellness products (air quality, circadian lighting)
- Subscription models (monthly unlimited passes)
- Cargo integration (preighter concept)

## Key Success Factors (PPT pg. 12, 30)

### **For Profitability**
- High load factors (>80%)
- Premium cabin yield optimization
- Fuel efficiency
- Labor productivity
- Ancillary revenue optimization
- Network optimization

### **Strategic Positioning**
- Strong premium product differentiation
- Ruthless cost efficiency (ULCC model)
- Technology leadership
- Sustainability credibility
- Flexible, adaptable strategy

## Critical Takeaways (PPT pg. 30)

**Evolution Pattern**: Luxury for all → Segmentation → Unbundling → Rebundling → Personalization

**Industry Trend**: Extreme polarization
- Ultra-premium luxury vs. ultra-basic transport
- Less middle ground
- Success requires picking a lane and executing flawlessly

**Biggest Uncertainties**:
- Sustainable fuel adoption speed
- Regulatory intervention on passenger experience
- Business travel recovery trajectory
- New aircraft technology timeline
